## Introduction
This project is the 8th coding module challenge that we had to complete as part of the Denver University AI Bootcamp coursework. 

The initial code provided for the challenge had us work with a CSV file of the company Mercado stock close price and its search trends, ingest it and then manipulate the data and perform an analysis on the data.
The challenge had one perform some data manipulation on the Stock price close data and also the Search trend data and eventually use the Prophet modelling capabilities to project the stocks prices in the near future. 


## Installation Requirements
*Requirements*: You must run Python 3.12.7 to execute the code as the code uses match case sytax that is older versions of python will not recognize.

## Usage
Anyone that is trying to familiarize themselves with Prophet modelling capabilities and use it to perfrom some level of rudimentary stock analysis while comparing it to the companys popularity via Search Trends.

## License
I've included the MIT License to encourage collaboration and use by the community.

## Acknowledgement / Contributing
Thank to the guidance of the Denver University AI Bootcamp Teachers Assistant's and their hints via comments that helped me complete this assignment. Without this I would've been completely lost. 

While a section of this code was written by the Denver University AI Bootcamp Teachers Assistant, it has been modified / completed by me.
